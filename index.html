        <h2>Profile Summary</h2>
        <p>
            I am a dedicated Python programmer with a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, 
            and Deep Learning. My journey began with structured programming courses and continued through extensive 
            hands-on experience with Python and modern AI frameworks. I am passionate about building intelligent 
            systems, understanding model architectures, and applying data-driven approaches to real-world problems.
        </p>

        <h2>Statement of Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            From an early stage in my education, computing offered me a structured way of understanding how intelligent 
            systems operate. Although I am not naturally driven by constant curiosity, I have always been highly 
            goal-oriented: once I commit to learning a subject, I pursue it with focus and consistency. This purposeful 
            approach shaped my early engagement with visual programming and digital design and eventually guided me 
            toward a deeper interest in artificial intelligence. My direction became clearer during a comprehensive 
            160-hour Python program at Amirkabir University, where I built and trained my first machine learning model. 
            This experience revealed how analytical thinking, programming, and data-driven modeling could come together 
            to solve meaningful problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            My academic preparation reflects a combination of strong analytical foundations and hands-on technical 
            training. High-school mathematics supported my transition into machine learning and deep learning. The 
            Python program at Amirkabir University—covering scientific computing, machine learning, security, game 
            development, web programming, and blockchain—allowed me to apply theoretical concepts to practical 
            projects. To expand my competencies further, I completed a Deep Learning course at Sharif University and 
            three additional programs in Python, Robotics, and IoT at Mohajer Technical and Vocational College. I am 
            currently enrolled in a 440-hour Artificial Intelligence Engineering program at Dayche Institute.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through these programs, I gained experience with the full AI development pipeline, including data 
            preparation, model building, deployment, and evaluation. I also developed proficiency using Python 
            libraries such as NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, and OpenCV. I’ve implemented various 
            machine-learning models, neural-network architectures, and computer-vision workflows.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also explored introductory research by working on a fake-news detection project using Graph Attention 
            Networks (GAT). Although my main focus is professional engineering rather than research, this experience 
            deepened my understanding of real-world challenges in AI systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            I aim to work at the intersection of engineering, data, and intelligent systems. My goal is to master the 
            methods and engineering practices required to build reliable, scalable AI solutions and pursue advanced 
            study in Artificial Intelligence.
